# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website. It's a simple website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the [typo](https://github.com/tomfran/typo) theme.

## Development

To run the site locally, you'll need to install Hugo. You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

Once you have Hugo installed, you can run the site locally by running the following command:

```bash
hugo server
```

## Deployment

The site is deployed automatically using Cloudflare Pages. Any changes to the `main` branch will be automatically deployed to the live site.
