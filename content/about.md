## Skills

### Software Engineering

I pride myself in writing clean, maintainable and tested code. I have shown this proficieincy through multiple projects both profesionally and personally. I am proficient in: Python, Golang and Bash and have good experience developing in Typescript (React frontend) and C

### Cloud and DevOps

Through multiple deliverables I have demonstrated experience and profficiency in cloud computing and devops. I am proficient in using Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins, Git and Terraform and have good experience with Openstack and public cloud concepts.

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is one of my main interests. I researched and implemented a machine learning project in my final year of university. I am also very interested in reading the latest uses of machine learning in the medical field.

### Systems Engineering/IoT

Previously engineered an unattended system which was inaccessable to any engineers. Safe power delivery and redundancies for important components meant that the system was consistent and continued returning data even during the harshest conditions.
